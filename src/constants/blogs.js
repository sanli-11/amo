    title: "Hands-On The Seiko Prospex SPB451 And SPB453",
    description:
      "Seiko makes a lot of dive watches – it's largely what they are known for. However, despite a range of models representing multiple philosophies, aesthetic eras, and price points, some hit much harder than others. Among the heavy hitters, we have the recently announced Prospex SPB451 and SPB453 – two mass-appeal takes on the brand's '60-inspired line of tool dive watches. Representing the second generation of a very popular line of watches established by the SPB143, these new Prospex divers offer a slight rethinking in the hopes of delivering a more well-rounded solution for a daily wear dive watch.",
